Open Source Trainee Question Bot. (For Parts/Doesn't Work)

Disclaimer: Bot is designed for airaTecha (ID: 723942880183320587) and its owner ChristopherAvia#3912 (ID: 460482042455392256) and project was abandoned after I couldn't figure out how to code a message collector to collect what she wanted me to do.

If you want to submit a pull request to fix the bot and make it work, you're more than welcome to do so. Just make sure that you direct message me on Discord, you can add my Princess Muednei of HuthekeriðŸ¦Š#0001 or join https://discord.gg/6ZxhN3d and direct message the Owner (as that's me).

This repo was meant for Christopher to get the bot fixed by somebody. If this person uses this repo, please make sure to include my GNU license in any of your releases, and leave my credits in the logs part. Feel free to add yourself there as well but leave me there too. Thanks.

If you want to use this if you're not working for airaTecha, feel free to do so in accordance with the GNU license provided.

Bot is powered by Essex Innovations (https://discord.gg/KyTeCTM), please feel free to make a ticket in accordance with bot development on there.
